# Flux Sync Status

## Current Situation

**Flux is working but stuck on old revision** because local commits haven't been pushed to GitHub.

- **Local commits**: 14 commits with all improvements
- **Remote revision**: `main@sha1:2463955aa79e1d9e1180fa9463b8b52efce1e8d4` (old)
- **Manual application**: All critical configs applied directly to cluster

## Current Working State

✅ **All systems operational:**
- Immich: https://immich.07c.me (admin@07c.me / admin123)
- API: Working (`{"res":"pong"}`)
- HTTPS: Working with staging certificates
- Admin user: Created and functional
- All pods: Running properly

## To Sync Repository with Cluster

### Option 1: Push to GitHub (Requires Auth)
```bash
# Set up GitHub authentication and push
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

### Option 2: Manual Configuration Updates
All configurations have been manually applied to the cluster:
- Immich initialization job ✅ 
- Admin user creation ✅
- Caddy staging certificates ✅
- All manifests deployed ✅

### Option 3: Update Flux Source (If needed)
```bash
# Force Flux to reconcile
kubectl annotate gitrepository flux-system -n flux-system reconcile.fluxcd.io/requestedAt="$(date +%s)" --overwrite
```
